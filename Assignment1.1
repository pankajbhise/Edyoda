(A) List 
(B) Dictionary 
(C) Tuple 
(D) Array 
Answer: (A)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.)How do you change the data type of a list?

To change a list into a tuple, we use the tuple() function

To change it into a set, we use the set() function

To change it into a dictionary, we use the dict() function

To change it into a string, we use the .join() method
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.)Explain the difference between Python arrays and lists.

In Python, both arrays and lists are used to store data. However,

· Arrays can only contain elements of the same data types, meaning the data types of an array should be homogeneous.

· Lists can contain elements of different data types, which means that the data types of lists can be heterogeneous. Lists consume much more memory than arrays.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.)Which data types are supported in Python?

Python has five standard data types:

· Numbers

· Strings

· Lists

· Tuples

· Dictionaries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.)What is the purpose of relational operators in Python?

Answer: The purpose of relational operators in Python is to compare values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.)What are assignment operators in Python?

Answer: The assignment operators in Python can help in combining all the arithmetic operators with the assignment symbol.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.)Why do we need membership operators in Python?

Answer: We need membership operators in Python with the purpose to confirm if the value is a member in another or not.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.)How are identity operators different than the membership operators?

Answer: Unlike membership operators, the identity operators compare the values to find out if they have the same value or not.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.) Which of the following is not used as loop in Python?

A. for loop
B. while loop
C. do-while loop 
D. None of the above
Answer: D
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.) Which of the following is False regarding loops in Python?

A. Loops are used to perform certain tasks repeatedly.
B. While loop is used when multiple statements are to executed repeatedly until the given condition becomes False 
C. While loop is used when multiple statements are to executed repeatedly until the given condition becomes True.
D. for loop can be used to iterate through the elements of lists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.) Which of the following is True regarding loops in Python?

A. Loops should be ended with keyword "end".
B. No loop can be used to iterate through the elements of strings. 
C. Keyword "break" can be used to bring control out of the current loop.
D. Keyword "continue" is used to continue with the remaining statements inside the loop.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.) Which one of the following is a valid Python if statement :

A. if a>=2 :
B. if (a >= 2) 
C. if (a => 22) 
D. if a >= 22
----------------------------------------------------
15) Can we write if/else into one line in python?

A. Yes
B. No
C. if/else not used in python
D. None of the above
--------------------------------------------------------
16.) What is a Python For Loop?

A for loop in Python requires at least two variables to work. The first is the iterable object such as a list, tuple or a string. And second is the variable to store the successive values from the sequence in the loop.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.) Python For Loop Syntax

In Python, you can use the “for” loop in the following manner.

for iter in sequence:

  statements(iter)

The “iter” represents the iterating variable. It gets assigned with the successive values from the input sequence.

The “sequence” may refer to any of the following Python objects such as a list, a tuple or a string.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
18.) How many basic types of functions are available in Python?

Python gives us two basic types of functions.

1. Built-in, and

2. User-defined.

The built-in functions happen to be part of the Python language. Some of these are print(), dir(), len(), and abs() etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.) ow do we write a function in Python?

We can create a Python function in the following manner.

Step-1: to begin the function, start writing with the keyword def and then mention the function name.

Step-2: We can now pass the arguments and enclose them using the parentheses. A colon, in the end, marks the end of the function header.

Step-3: After pressing an enter, we can add the desired Python statements for execution.

-------------------------------------------------------
20.) What is a function call or a callable object in Python?

A function in Python gets treated as a callable object. --
It can allow some arguments and also return a value or multiple values in the form of a tuple.--
Apart from the function, Python has other constructs, such as classes or the class instances which fits in the same category.
